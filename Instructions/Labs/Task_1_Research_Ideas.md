# Task 1: Research Program Ideas

Using Microsoft 365 Business Chat, research innovative educational programs or initiatives outside of TEALS. The goal is to find inspiration and explore successful elements that could inform the design of a new TEALS program. Consider emerging trends in technology education and literacy, as well as challenges faced by underserved communities.

### Example Prompts

- **Step 1:** 
    ```text
    Can you help me identify gaps in existing technology education programs, specifically in underserved areas? I want to focus on challenges students face in accessing tech resources.
    ```
- **Step 2:** 
    ```text
    Now, based on those gaps, can you suggest actionable program elements for TEALS that address these specific challenges?
    ```
- **Step 3:** 
    ```text
    What potential roadblocks could TEALS face when implementing these ideas, and how can we mitigate them?
    ```

> [!NOTE] 
> - Focus on identifying gaps or new opportunities TEALS could capitalize on.
> - Save the insights into a Word document titled “TEALS Program Research.”
> - The example prompts are just that, an example. Use them as a guide to build your own prompts

### Chain of Thought Prompoting (CoT)

A CoT prompt is a series of connected questions or statements designed to guide a person or AI through a step-by-step reasoning process. It helps break down complex topics by prompting the thinker to address one aspect at a time, building on previous responses to develop a deeper understanding or more comprehensive solution. Each step in the chain encourages reflection or analysis, with each question leading logically to the next, facilitating structured problem-solving or exploration.

For example, we may have the following prompt:

```text
What are the long-term impacts of this program on tech literacy among high school students?
```
And then we may follow that prompt up with:

```text
Based on this impact, what partnerships could TEALS pursue to sustain and scale the program?
```

By using a CoT prompt, you encourage deeper engagement with the subject matter, leading to more thoughtful and well-rounded answers. This approach fosters a logical progression of ideas, making it easier to explore complex scenarios and arrive at actionable insights.
