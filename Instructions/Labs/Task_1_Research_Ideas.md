# Task 1: Research Program Ideas

Using Business Chat in the Microsoft 365 App (Microsoft.com/Copilot), research innovative educational programs or initiatives outside of TEALS. The goal is to find inspiration and explore successful elements that could inform the design of a new program. Consider emerging trends in technology education and literacy.
### Steps:

1. To launch Business Chat, open a new Edge browser tab and navigate to [microsoft.com/copilot](https://Microsoft.com/copilot)

2. If prompted to sign in, log into your work account.

3. With BizChat open, ensure that the **Web tab** is selected:

4. Explore the different prompting techniques below to help you use Business Chat.

5. Once you are finished researching your new program idea, save your program idea insights to the Word file you created earlier, titled **TEALS Program Research.docx**, for use in the next task.

> [!NOTE] 
> - Focus on identifying gaps or new opportunities TEALS could capitalize on.
> - Save the insights into a Word document titled “TEALS Program Research.”
> - The example prompts are just that, an example. Use them as a guide to build your own prompts

### Chain of Thought Prompting

A CoT prompt is a series of connected questions or statements designed to guide a person or AI through a step-by-step reasoning process. It helps break down complex topics by prompting the thinker to address one aspect at a time, building on previous responses to develop a deeper understanding or more comprehensive solution. Each step in the chain encourages reflection or analysis, with each question leading logically to the next, facilitating structured problem-solving or exploration.

For example

- **Prompt 1:** 
    ```text
    Can you help me identify gaps in existing technology education programs, specifically in underserved areas? I want to focus on challenges students face in accessing tech resources.
    ```
- **Prompt 2:** 
    ```text
    Now, based on those gaps, can you suggest actionable program elements that address these specific challenges?
    ```
- **Prompt 3:** 
    ```text
    Considering the program elements we've discussed, which single program would be the most impactful and feasible for my team to pursue? Please prioritize based on scalability and potential long-term benefits.
    ```
By using a CoT prompt, you encourage deeper engagement with the subject matter, leading to more thoughtful and well-rounded answers. This approach fosters a logical progression of ideas, making it easier to explore complex scenarios and arrive at actionable insights.

### Single-Shot Prompting 

Single-shot prompting is a technique where a single, well-crafted prompt is used to generate a comprehensive response from the AI. This method works best when you need a quick, broad overview or when the problem or question is relatively straightforward. It allows the AI to generate a full response in one go, without the need for iterative questions.

For example

- **Prompt:** 
    ```text
    Can you provide a comprehensive overview of current challenges in technology education for underserved communities, and suggest program ideas that could address these challenges?
    ```
In this method, you rely on the AI's ability to provide a detailed and holistic response based on the single prompt. This approach is more efficient when you're seeking a broad summary or a quick solution, but it may not allow for the same depth of exploration as Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting.
