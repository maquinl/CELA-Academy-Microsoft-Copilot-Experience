Based on your research using BizChat, use Copilot in Word to draft a comprehensive proposal for your new TEALS initiative. The proposal should include the program’s objectives, target audience, expected outcomes, and key strategies for success.

### Steps:

1. Open the program research document that you saved to your OneDrive account in Task 1. Copy the URL of the document by selecting the Share button in the upper-right corner, above the ribbon and selecting Copy Link from the drop-down menu that appears.

    > The example prompts are just that, an example. Use them as a guide to build your own prompts

1. Select Generate. At this point, Copilot in Word extracts the information from your Research document and drafts a proposal.

1. Review the draft Copilot in Word creates. If you think everything looks good, you can move onto the next Step. 

    However, if you'd like refine the document further, explore the information in the **Iterate and revise** section below.

1. Save the file to your OneDrive account with the following file name: **Program Proposal.docx**. The next exercise uses this document.


### Iterate and Revise

The iterative and revision process involves refining and improving upon an initial draft or concept through multiple rounds of feedback and adjustment. This approach helps to enhance the quality, clarity, and effectiveness of the final output by identifying areas for improvement and making targeted revisions.

For example, you might start with an initial draft of a proposal and prompt the following:

```text
Can you refine this proposal by making it more persuasive for potential sponsors?
```
After reviewing the updated version, you may further improve the document by focusing on specific sections, such as:

```text
Improve the executive summary to make it more concise and impactful.
```

This explanation emphasizes how iterative revision helps refine content through a series of thoughtful adjustments, leading to more persuasive and impactful results.
