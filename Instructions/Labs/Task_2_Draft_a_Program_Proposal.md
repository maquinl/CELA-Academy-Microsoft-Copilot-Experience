# Task 2: Draft a Program Proposal

Based on your research, use Copilot in Word to draft a comprehensive proposal for your new TEALS initiative. The proposal should include the program’s objectives, target audience, expected outcomes, and key strategies for success.

### Example Prompts

- **Step 1**: Initial Prompt

    ```text
    Based on the research in [/TEALS Program Research.docx], draft a program proposal for TEALS. Focus first on the program’s core objectives.
    ```

- **Step 2**: Follow-up Prompt

        ```text
        Now, refine the proposal by including concrete examples from other successful programs in underserved communities. How can TEALS differentiate itself?
        ```

- **Step 2**: Cross-referencing

    ```text
    Incorporate key stats and insights from [/TEALS Program Research.docx] into the proposal. Use specific data points from pages 3 and 4 of the document.”
    ```

> [!NOTE] 
> - If the “TEALS Program Proposal” document does not display in the reference file list, share the document and copy the link into the prompt field within Copilot in Word.
> - Save the PowerPoint file as “TEALS Program Pitch” onto your OneDrive account.
> - The example prompts are just that, an example. Use them as a guide to build your own prompts


### Iterate and Revise

The iterative and revision process involves refining and improving upon an initial draft or concept through multiple rounds of feedback and adjustment. This approach helps to enhance the quality, clarity, and effectiveness of the final output by identifying areas for improvement and making targeted revisions.

For example, you might start with an initial draft of a proposal and prompt the following:

```text
Can you refine this proposal by making it more persuasive for potential sponsors?
```
After reviewing the updated version, you may further improve the document by focusing on specific sections, such as:

```text
Improve the executive summary to make it more concise and impactful.
```

This explanation emphasizes how iterative revision helps refine content through a series of thoughtful adjustments, leading to more persuasive and impactful results.
