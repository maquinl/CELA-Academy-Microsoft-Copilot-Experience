# Task 3: Create a Program Pitch Presentation

Using the Word document created in Task 2, leverage Copilot in PowerPoint to develop a professional pitch deck. The presentation should be designed to communicate the vision, goals, and benefits of the proposed program to potential stakeholders or sponsors.

### Steps:

1. Open the program proposal document that you saved to your OneDrive account in Task 2. Copy the URL of the document by selecting the Share button in the upper-right corner, above the ribbon and selecting Copy Link from the drop-down menu that appears.

1. Launch Microsoft PowerPoint from your browser ([PowerPoint.new](https://PowerPoint.new)) or use the desktop application.

1. Open a new blank presentation.

1. In the Copilot pane that appears, several predefined prompts are available for you to choose from. Select the Create presentation from file prompt.

1. Copy and paste the **Program proposal.docx** link after the words "Create a presentation from" and select **Send**.

    the full prompt should looke like:

    ```text 
    Create a presentation from [Link to Program Rproposal.docx]
    ```

1. Copilot will start to create a slide presentation based on the Program Proposal document. In doing so, it displays the outline of the presentation and a list of features included in the presentation. These features may include speaker notes, images, layouts to organize slides, and a General sensitivity label.

    > [!NOTE] 
    > It can take up to two minutes for the slides to fully generate. The time it takes to generate the slides depends on the complexity of the document and the number of slides that Copilot creates.

1. Once completed, you're now free to review the slides and make any necessary updates. You can use the Designer tool to adjust the layouts. You can also add or remove slides, and modify the content as needed to ensure that the presentation aligns with your objectives. For more prompt to test out, see the next section below.

### More Prompts to test out in Copilot in PowerPoint

Copilot in PowerPoint offers powerful tools to optimize and enhance presentations. You can leverage these features to improve the visual and structural elements of your slides, ensuring that your content is presented in the most effective way.

For example, Copilot can suggest alternative slide layouts based on the content provided, as well as automatically format presentations. You can experiment with Copilot’s suggestions by asking for recommendations on the best order to present your information for maximum impact:

 ```text
 What’s the best order to present this information for maximum impact?
 ```

You should also explore Copilot’s ability to refine and improve your presentation through iteration. This could involve revisiting Copilot’s suggestions with a more specific focus, such as:

 ```text
 Give me specific examples from this presentation on how I can improve it for better engagement.
 ```
Another way to use Copilot is by adding new slides to address key aspects of your program. For instance, you can ask Copilot to generate slides on potential challenges and strategies:

 ```text
Add 2 slides detailing potential challenges this program may face, and include a slide that outlines key strategies to mitigate those challenges.
 ```
By exploring these advanced features, you can create more engaging and professional presentations while learning how to continuously iterate and improve your designs using Copilot’s intelligent recommendations.
