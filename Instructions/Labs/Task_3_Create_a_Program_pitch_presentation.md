# Task 3: Create a Program Pitch Presentation

Using the Word document created in Task 2, leverage Copilot in PowerPoint to develop a professional pitch deck. The presentation should be designed to communicate the vision, goals, and benefits of the proposed program to potential stakeholders or sponsors.

### Example Prompts

- **Step 1**: Initial Prompt
    ```text
    Create a PowerPoint presentation based on the document [/TEALS Program Proposal.docx]. Start with 3 slides that summarize the program objectives, the gap TEALS fills, and the expected outcomes.
    ```

- **Step 2**: Follow-up Prompt
    ```text 
    Now, add 2 slides detailing potential challenges TEALS might face, and include a slide that outlines key strategies to mitigate those challenges.
    ```

- **Step 3**: Follow-up Prompt
    ```text
    For each slide, can you suggest a visual format (e.g., chart, infographic, bullet points) that best communicates the information?
    ```

- **Step 4**: Design prompt 
    ```text
    Adjust the design of the slides to emphasize the key points. Add icons or relevant imagery to enhance clarity.
    ```

> [!NOTE] 
> - If the “TEALS Program Proposal” document does not display in the reference file list, share the document and copy the link into the prompt field within Copilot in PowerPoint.
> - Save the PowerPoint file as “TEALS Program Pitch” onto your OneDrive account.
> - The example prompts are just that, an example. Use them as a guide to build your own prompts

### Advanced Use of Features

In more advanced use cases, Copilot offers powerful tools to optimize and enhance presentations. You can leverage these features to improve the visual and structural elements of your slides, ensuring that your content is presented in the most effective way.

For example, Copilot can suggest alternative slide layouts based on the content provided, as well as automatically format presentations. You can experiment with Copilot’s suggestions by asking for recommendations on the best order to present your information for maximum impact:

 ```text
 What’s the best order to present this information for maximum impact?"
 ```

You should also explore Copilot’s ability to refine and improve your presentation through iteration. This could involve revisiting Copilot’s suggestions with a more specific focus, such as:

 ```text
Give me specific examples from this presentation on how I can improve it for better engagement."
```

By exploring these advanced features, you can create more engaging and professional presentations while learning how to continuously iterate and improve your designs using Copilot’s intelligent recommendations.
