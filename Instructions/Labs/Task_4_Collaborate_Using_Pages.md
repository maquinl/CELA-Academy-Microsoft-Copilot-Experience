### Task 4: Collaborate Using Pages 

For this task, you’ll be using the Work tab in Business Chat to experience the new “Pages” functionality, which allows you to collaborate and organize ideas in a dynamic, shareable space. Pages act much like Loop components, making it easy to capture and refine content directly within your chat.

### Steps:

1. To launch Business Chat, open a new Edge browser tab and navigate to [microsoft.com/copilot](https://Microsoft.com/copilot)

2. If prompted to sign in, log into your work account.

3. With BizChat open, ensure that the **Work tab** is selected:

4. Type the following prompt:

    ```text
    Using [link to powerpoint] & [link to proposal] Can you help me summarize the key elements from my new program into a concise action plan, including next steps for implementation and key milestones?
    ```
5. Copilot will provide a structured response that you can add directly to a Page. Select the **Pages** Option beneith copilots responds
